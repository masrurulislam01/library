Hi!, welcome to my repository. The Library Management System (LMS) is developed for transforming manual offline workload into online automatic system. It contains all the main features such as adding and managing students, books with efficiently maintaining their data. It also contains other security features such as Captcha Verification and Password Encryption. This is a complete LMS with all the necessary functionalties. It also provides feature to generate report and manage fine.

Note: This is an extended version of Library Management System that can be found here. I have added more advance functionalities like report generation.
